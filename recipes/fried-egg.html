    <img src="../images/fried-egg.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A fried egg can be put in many foods, or eaten by itself. In this recipe, we will be cooking it alone, but this doesn't mean you have to eat it alone. The greatest thing about doing the meal this way is you only need an egg to start, but you can add whatever you'd like from there!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Large Grade-A Egg</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare pan by preheating to medium heat with 1 tbs of butter.</li>
        <li>Once heated, crack the egg on the side of the pan and let it fry for about a minute on each side for a over-medium finish.</li>
        <li>Let the egg cool on a plate, then add salt and pepper to your liking.</li>
    </ol>
